## Hi there!

I'm a 2nd-year MChem Chemistry student at Durham University with interests at the chemistry-biology interface.

This site hosts some of my earlier project work (c. 2020-2022) in Java and Python.

A smaller project I led at a similar time can be found [here](https://gitlab.com/cachs/cardyhoney-website) and [here](https://gitlab.com/cachs/microbees).

More recent technical experience includes Python for university-level data analysis and visualisation. I'm currently expanding my knowledge base into chemical simulations and the use of machine learning in biochemistry.
